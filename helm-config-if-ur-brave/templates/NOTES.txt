To deploy this application in you cluster, you don't have to customize any configurations, but if you want...
You're free to edit the Statefulset, the service, The autoscaler, or the Resource quota. 

Directly reference my values.yaml within the repo when designing you custom configuration.
Hopefully this is fairly easy to undertand an not to difficult.
My the Baldheads be disposed upon you if you're able to replicate this setup.
